# Project Features
- This is a full-stack online polling survey app.
- Users can log in via Facebook using Firebase authentication and also create a new account.
- Users can participate in online polling.
- Pro users can complete their payments using online payment (Stripe).
- There are admin, surveyor, and user dashboards. The admin can manage all users and surveys.
- Pro users can also make comments, and users can report a survey.
- Surveyors have the ability to create and edit surveys.

# Faced Challenge

- In the reporting section, users can submit reports. After receiving reports, the admin unpublishes the survey and sends a message to the survey creator.
- Using Material UI for the first time, I only implemented a navbar, and it was challenging for me.
